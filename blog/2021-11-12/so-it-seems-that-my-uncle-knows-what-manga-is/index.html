	<p>We were all in London at someone's wedding (I can't remember)...</p>
    <p>...he came up to my sisters phone at the london wedding and asked if what she was reading was manga but it was just a gacha life video.</p> 
	<p>Then he told me to watch "FULL METAL ALCHEMIST" for some reason...?</p>
	<p>So he watches anime --- nerd! Maybe this is suddenly widely accepted and I'm wasting my time writing this... or maybe the millenials have gone mad!</p>
	<p>Too much internet culture for one day! I’m out!! also i’m typing this in a toilet >.< </p>
