    <p>Ahhhh Sonic CD, a game I actually played when I was pretty young because I think it was free on PS3 or something similar.</p>
    <p>The fact that it has two soundtracks, and four different states of levels was interesting. As a kid I didn't really know 
      you had to get a "good future" but I still knew how to travel to the past and future. Recently I've rediscovered these 
      soundtracks which have been rooted in the back of my mind for years  ^-^</p>
    <p>Being in the UK, we got the JP/EU (Japanese/Europe) OST instead of the US (North America) OST. Let's compare them.</p>
    <h2>The Opening</h2>
    <p>US | JP/EU</p>

      <b>Lyrics:</b><br/>
      If you're strong<br/>
      You can fly<br/>
      You can reach the other side<br/>
      Of the rainbow<br/>
      <br/>
      It's all right<br/>
      Take a chance<br/>
      Cause there is no circumstance<br/>
      That you can't handle<br/>
      When you use your mind<br/>
      <br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>(Trouble keeps you running
      faster)<br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>(Save the planet from
      disaster)<br/>
      <br/>
      Through the dark<br/>
      To the light<br/>
      It's a supersonic flight<br/>
      Gotta keep it goin'<br/>
      <br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>(Trouble keeps you running
      faster)<br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>(Save the planet from
      disaster)<br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>(Spinning through a world in
      motion)<br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom

      <b>Lyrics:</b><br/>
      10 - 10 Here we go again!<br/>
      9 - 9 Don't fall behind!<br/>
      8 - 8 Say, don't be late!<br/>
      7 - 7 Destination heaven!<br/>
      6 - 5 Stay alive!<br/>
      4 - 3 Now it's you and me!<br/>
      2 - 1 We're gonna have fun<br/>
      Say, blast off! Hey!<br/>
      <br/>
      Excalibur - It's not that far<br/>
      What do ya make? - Give & Take<br/>
      Goin' home - Time Zone<br/>
      Check out egg - He's never alone<br/>
      Leather'n Lace - Getting in Place<br/>
      What do y' get? - Say, fast jet!<br/>
      Doom Room - Cosmic zoom<br/>
      Heads up, Jake - It's Sonic boom!<br/>
      <br/>
      Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior - <br/>Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior<br/>
      Your hour is near at hand,<br/>
      You've got the power to save the land!<br/>
      <br/>
      Take a little chance - Slip on through<br/>
      You gotta survive no matter what you do<br/>
      You gotta do for you<br/>
      <br/>
      Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior - <br/>Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior<br/>
      The power is in your mind<br/>
      To save the planet and conquer time!<br/>
      <br/>
      Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior<br/>
      Deep in space and time<br/>
      Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior<br/>
      Forever in your mind!<br />
      Nothing can survive, the will to stay alive<br/>
      'Cause if you try, you can do anything!<br/>
      <br/>
      Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior<br/>
      Always takes a chance<br/>
      Toot, toot, Sonic Warrior<br/>
      Never says he can't!<br/>
      <br/>
      Nothing can survive, the will to stay alive<br/>
      'Cause if you try, you can do anything!<br/>

    <p>The PS3 version (Sonic CD 2011) had an instrumental version of the JP/EU opening, which I never knew had lyrics!! ;-;
    <br/>This is what this version looked like:</p>
    <p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" width="720" height="480" 
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/asa-gvqPfTg?start=80" title="YouTube video player" ></iframe></p>
    <p>Let's just ignore the fact that this version scaled the 4:3 animation to 16:9 (～￣▽￣)～</p>
    <h2>Palmtree Paradise</h2>
    <p>Additionally the first level (zone): "Palmtree Paradise", sounds different in regions.</p>
    <p>US | JP/EU</p>
    <p><video width="400" height="225" controls><source src="Palmtree Panic Present US - Sonic CD.mp4"/></video>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    <video width="400" height="225" controls><source src="Palmtree Panic Present JPEU - Sonic CD.mp4"/></video></p>
    <h2>Stardust Speedway Good Future</h2>
    <p>Also, the JP/EU has a unique track for a level in a good future! Just listen to this:</p>
    <p><video width="400" height="225" controls><source src="Stardust Speedway Good Future JPEU - Sonic CD.mp4"/></video></p>
    <h2>The Ending</h2>
    <p>Ohhh the ending felt so cool! Animation like this is something you could never forget...</p>
    <p>US | JP/EU</p>

      Mr. Bad's<br/>
      Got it good<br/>
      But this ain't his neighborhood<br/>
      He's taking over, no, no<br/>
      <br/>
      Time is now<br/>
      He can't hide<br/>
      Find the power deep inside<br/>
      And make it happen<br/>
      <br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>
      (Trouble keeps you running faster)<br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>
      (Save the planet from disaster)<br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>
      (Spinning through a world in motion)<br/>
      Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom <br/>
      (Take it all the way!)<br/>
      <br/>
      Make your move<br/>
      Break it out<br/>
      That's what life is all about<br/>
      It's your adventure<br/>
      <br/>
      Through the dark<br/>
      To the light<br/>
      It's a supersonic flight<br/>
      Got to keep it goin'<br/>

      <b>Lyrics:</b><br/>
      In the end, who's on your side?<br/>
      Who can you trust, in the middle of the night?<br/>
      Where will you be, if you can't find you?<br/>
      There's no place to go, nothing to do<br/>
      If you gotta do something, gotta do something<br/>
      Believe in yourself - yourself - yourself - hey<br/>
      <br/>
      Extraordinary things can happen if you believe<br/>
      in yourself<br/>
      You've got to have some faith in yourself<br/>
      If you want respect from your friends<br/>
      <br/>
      Don't re-arrange, no need to change<br/>
      Stay like you are, keep it all the same<br/>
      But as you move along in your life<br/>
      Keep an open mind and don't forget<br/>
      That if ya gotta do something, gotta do something<br/>
      Believe in yourself - yourself - yourself - hey<br/>
      <br/>
      Extraordinary things can happen if you believe<br/>
      in yourself<br/>
      You've got to have some faith in yourself<br/>
      If you want respect from your friends<br/>
      <br/>
      When you feel tight, look at yourself!<br/>
      Inside your heart you will find a special place<br/>
      to unwind<br/>
      When you feel right, look at yourself<br/>
      Inside your mind you will see<br/>
      Cosmic eternity<br/>
      <br/>
      When you feel tight, look at yourself!<br/>
      Inside your heart you will find a special place<br/>
      to unwind<br/>
      When you feel right, look at yourself<br/>
      Inside your mind you will see<br/>
      Cosmic eternity<br/>
    </div></div>
    <p>I think they're both cool! What an interesting game... Sonic CD will always have one of the most memorable openings and OSTs!</p>
