    <p>Had a very weird dream!</p>
    <p>I had a really weird dream where me and my mother and sister just ended up on a Japanese motorway ( well a wide motorway that was 
      "allegedly" in Japan, but all the signs were in English anyways ). And then I said "woah all the signs are in English".</p>
    <div class="image"><img src="JPD01.png"></div>
    <p>It was probably a lot cloudier than this paint drawing.</p>
    <p>And then we just end up on foot in this small area full of small blue rooms, there were children just wandering around... I think they were small shops trying to sell something but this was more like the backrooms... </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="JPD02.png"></div>
    <p>And that's about it. This place scares me!!!</p>
